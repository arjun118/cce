## Progress

- improvement in room functionality
- store the code and selected language in local storage
- and upon refresh set the code and language accordingly and emit to the other guys just in case

## issues

- need to find a way to store the current code and langauge efficiently so that the session persists
- another design idea can be that
  - no need to persist these are just shortlived, focus on deployment

## features to add

### Room chat

- add a chat window so that users can chat and implement unique username so that you can display the username and message accordingly
- implement typing status

### Save the code in the room so that user can revisit the code

- not joining the room again and continuing the session but just able to see the code
